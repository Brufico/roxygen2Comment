# An RStudio addin for roxygen2 code blocks
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csgillespie/roxygen2Comment.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/csgillespie/roxygen2Comment) 
[![CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/roxygen2Comment)](http://cran.rstudio.com/package=roxygen2Comment)

RStudio addins let you execute a bit of R code or a Shiny app through the RStudio IDE,
either via the Addins dropdown menu or with a keyboard shortcut. This package contains an RStudio addin for commenting roxygen2 code.

This package can be installed via
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("csgillespie/roxygen2Comment")
```

## Running addins

After installing the package, the _Addins_ menu toolbar will be populated with the 
new, exported addin. The addin will work exactly like the RStudio keyboard
shortcut for commenting. 

  * If you execute the addin on standard code, it will add `#'` to the start of the line.
  * If you execute the addin on an roxygen2 comment, it will remove `#'`

## Manage your addins

See my other [package](https://github.com/csgillespie/addinmanager) for
conviently adding and removing RStudio addins.


## Other information

 * If you have any suggestions or find bugs, please use the github issue tracker.
 * Feel free to submit pull requests for new addins.
